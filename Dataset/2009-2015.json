This problem can affect the accuracy and relevance of results inferred by semantic engines and leads to the requirement of using effective disambiguation techniques to process entities as part of the enhancement process in the semantic engines. This proposal focuses on using FOAF profiles as a datasource and process them to resolve name ambiguity problem in an effective way.\r \rFOAF is a vocabulary used to describe people, organizations and groups in the form of linked data to form an entity network on the web. The relationship of these FOAF instances can be very useful to derive new knowledge about entities using semantic techniques. Some of the FOAF instances may denote the same entity in different approaches with different information. Therefore it's essential to identify which FOAF instances are describing the same entity over the web and identify the co-reference relationship between them. The co-reference analysis can use FOAF attributes such as mbox, homepage, weblog, as unique identifiers (inverse functional properties) to match FOAF instances to identify co-referent clusters and use it to disambiguate entities over the web. This project aims to develop a comprehensive disambiguation algorithm by identifying and clustering co-referent FOAF instances which describes the same entity over the web. \r\rFurthermore, integration of FOAF profile support in Stanbol can be useful to develop a user network in content management systems and improve access control of content using social graph techniques.

Two nodes connect when they scan each other's QR codes.

However, experimental results show that Polly analysis and optimization can lead to significant compile-time overhead. On average, Polly optimization will increase the compile time by 393% for PolyBench benchmarks and by 53% for MediaBench benchmarks. That means if you want to gain from Polly, you have to pay 4 times extra compile-time overhead. Even if you do not want to gain much from Polly, you still have to pay 53% compile-time overhead. Such expensive compile-time overhead would make Polly much less attractive to LLVM users. I argue that maintaining fast compile time when Polly is enabled is very important, especially if we think of enabling Polly in default for all LLVM users. Based on this assumption, this project tries to reduce Polly compile-time overhead by revising a large number of Polly passes. First, I will revising some hot Polly passes that dominate the total compile-time overhead; Second, I will revisit Polly canonicalization passes and try to let the Polly bail out early, so Polly will not cause much overhead when it cannot optimize program; Third, I will revisit and improve Polly optimization passes and code generation passes, so Polly can be much faster when it can optimize program. I hope this project can benefit both LLVM users and Polly users. For LLVM users who care more about compile-time overhead, it enables Polly to provide extra performance gains within little extra compile-time overhead. For Polly users who care more about code quality, this project will significantly reduce the compile-time overhead without performance loss.

Recently, a plugin was developed that leverages SH for the visual analysis of content-based medical image retrieval (VAMIR). Different from traditional approaches relying on textual annotations and queries, content-based image retrieval (CBIR) exploits visual features that in the medical domain may comprise segmented anatomical or pathological regions, their spatial relationships, volume and texture as well as Wavelet- and Fourier-transformations. A typical CBIR framework presents the user a result list sorted according to some similarity metric that accumulates all features used for image comparison. This way, no insight is given on which and how features have contributed to the ranking. In a novel approach, the VAMIR plugin allowed SH to visualize the outcome of a CBIR algorithm in a way that enables the user to make judgements about a query\u00e2\u0080\u0099s similarity to other database entries with respect to selected features. \u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Motivation for this project:\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0The tool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s performance is promising, but VAMIR is still at a prototype stage.

So the target is to makes these SWIG interface files \u00e2\u0080\u009cleaner and meaner\u00e2\u0080\u009d. This target can be achieved by clearing the C++ style wrappers in SWIG interface files and replacinge them with C wrappers contained by several SWIG interface files. The other possible way is to use CYTHON rewriting the interface between C/C++ and PYTHON.

To maintain the system in consistent state while building several ports it is necessary to prevent concurrent access to shared files and directories from multiple processes.

An important aspect of my project is dealing with various failures and unexpected terminations of port\u00e2\u0080\u0099s build process to avoid any deadlock situations and inconsistent state of the ports system.

This is substantially achieved by sniffing for mDNS packets on the final users' networks (usually HNA networks), encapsulating them inside OLSR protocol messages, exploiting OLSR native message transfer mechanisms, and decapsulating the mDNS packets at all the other end users' networks. The plug-in has been developed by ninux.org members, however we would like to address some important issues that have arised during deployment: loops. If two mDNS plug-in enabled OLSR routers are attached to the same HNA network, then mDNS packets will loop back and forth between the two, also flooding the whole OLSR network. For the moment the temporary solution to this problem is to enable the plug-in on one router at a time on the same HNA. A real solution to the problem would be the following: usually mDNS packets have a TTL != 1, so: capture only mDNS packets with TTL != 1 when decapsulating mDNS packets, set TTL = 1 where TTL is the IP Time-to-live field capture rate. mDNS packets are incapsulated into OLSR messages, which in turn are contained in OLSR packets that are sent at the wireless basic rate (i.e. 1 or 2 Mbps) over the whole network. Thus a big amount of mDNS captured packets in a small time can slow down the whole network. A solution to this is to add a plug-in configuration option to set the maximum packet capture rate.

Essentially, write scripts that would modify the existing localization work into a format suitable for MT system learning. These scripts will extend those that of \"Transvision\" which produces tmx files nightly. Based on the output of this step, a list will be created that would contain the entries, terms, words and the corresponding suggested translation. Corrections to this will be made, if any, manually. This then will be organized into a database along with a small web portal that will help contributors to l10n find words and preferred translations real easy.

At the outset the aim will be to do this for 4 languages (due to lingual restrictions in initial verification) but later extended to all languages supported by Mozilla.

I propose a tentative time-line, outline appropriate milestones and discuss anticipated development hurdles and how I intend to avoid them.\r      ", "link": "https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2009/orgs/gephi/projects/pjmcswee.html"}, {"title": "Vectorial Preview", "description": "        Gephi is able to export its network as SVG or PDF format. Using vectorial drawings for graph have many benefits like infinite zooming or clear shapes. The aim of this proposal is to develop a preview module in Gephi for seeing how the output will exactly looks like with the given parameters.\r\rWhereas the embedded 3D engine is designed for efficient network exploration the vectorial export concentrate on clarity, readability and outstanding design. This module has many different settings like edge thickness, arrow size, white borders around labels, node border and so on. In the vein of WYSIWYG editors we would like to see direct setting change on a Vectorial Preview window. The module must be scalable to support large networks.\r\rTo resume there are two requirements, previewing the network exactly how it will looks-like in output and support huge graphs efficiently.\r\rAn approach proposed by the mentors consists in using the output generated by the Gephi Rich SVG Export module to reconstruct and display the network. By importing the demo input \"celegans.gexf\", the generated SVG file has size 1.8MB. Building the preview from an SVG file generated each time an option is (un)checked seems to be a too loud process appearing not to be scalable for large networks, especially on old computers. Moreover, there does not seem to be a \"transitory\" state of data: data is directly exported to SVG in the ExporterSVG class.\r\rFinally, my approach is to generalize the vectorial transformation process into a class called ExporterVectorial, for instance, in which the final shape of rendering is abstracted: it will create a new transitory data set designed for a vectorial output. By (un)checking any option, ExporterVectorial will be called, generating the vectorial data that a new class VectorialPreview will render on the SVG export panel using Java 2D. When the \"Finish\" button will be pressed, ExporterVectorial will be called again and then ExporterSVG will use the output data to render it into the SVG format. In fact, SVG and preview outputs will come from a same data input designed especially for vectorial rendering. In addition, an idea could be to implement a \"Preview\" checkbox on each vectorial export panel, which would allow people using old computers to choose if they want an automatic preview or not.\r\rNevertheless, the main interrogations are:\r    * will the graph be displayed entirely or partially?\r    * if displayed partially, how to browse it and make the preview readable?\r\rAbout the development method, a new Bazaar branch will be created from a \"rather stable\" Gephi development version, and the work will be done on it. Once the GSOC ended, it is hoped that it will be merged into the trunk branch.\r\rHere is the planning schedule:\r    * April 20th - May 23rd: understanding of existing Gephi code, following of current development evolution;\r    * May 23rd - June 26th: class diagram design, Java 2D API discovering, rendering few nodes in the preview window then thousands/millions to test performance;\r    * June 27th - August 17th: proper development of the proposed approach.

In-addition, if publications (Journal e.g. JASIST (Wiley), IPM (Elsevier) or Conference e.g. JCDL, ECDL) can be segregated based on ranking it would add much value from management perspective. A summarized report in this form from various academic disciplines in Institutes of higher learning would definitely drive strong interest from the stakeholders of Institutional Repositories. Our plan is to achieve this report generation based on data extracted from the Dspace IR and present this grouped by various custom filter options such as author, contribution period, publication ranking, and summarized report for each academic discipline etc. The motivation to this proposal is based on feedback received from the academic community during a presentation that was meant for encouraging contribution into repositories.

If you are watching live TV and a recording is about to start on a different channel the daemon should automatically switch to the channel of the recording.\r\rAnother major goal is to better integrate GNOME DVB Daemon into Totem. Only experienced users can make use of Totem's DVB features, because you have to generate the channel list with a command line tool and place the generated file in a special place. Additionally, it's only possible to use multiple DVB adapters if they are all of the same type. DVB Daemon already addresses all of the above issues, but it is not well integrated into Totem, yet.\r\rYou should be able to access all features (scanning for channels, recording/watching channels, browsing EPG and recordings) of the daemon directly within Totem. Ideally, the user just plugs in his DVB adapter and the assistant to scan for channels is started automatically if the device is not configured, yet.\r\rFurthermore, Totem should use a ring buffer when watching live TV. This allows the user to pause live TV, rewind it and fast forward later. This feature will involve work on GStreamer's queue2 element.\r\rA simple channel list editor is currently missing, too. That's especially annoying with DVB-S where you have thousands of channels but you are only interested in a small fraction of them. It should be possible to select the favorite channels after the scan is completed.\r\rIn addition, I want to provide a way to aggregate EPG data from different sources with additional metadata via a plugin system. Some channels don't provide EPG data in their transport stream or the data is incomplete. Retrieving the EPG informations from an online service would obviously fix this problem and may even provide additional metadata.\r\rLast but not least, I want to add a way to schedule reoccurring recordings so you can easily record you favorite TV show.
